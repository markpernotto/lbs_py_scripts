This repository represents a few scripts used to massage data from an endpoint in preparation to use in a different application: https://github.com/markpernotto/search_scan_sql

For security reasons, I've ommitted the `lc.py` file, which contains private/confidential access keys to the endpoint in question. However, the format for the file looks like this:

<pre><code>

c = {'account_id': '1234',
    'client_id': 'kvu7H849fjf283hfudhfowuhfie8h28y72g437gf9274f9278gf09b2',
    'client_secret': 'jnnfnbov2uuh2hlkrjrisf9syhusgfnidshg',
    'refresh_token': 'mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmgooooooooooood'
}

</code></pre>

### todo:
add api to serve data
